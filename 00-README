## 01- 3D-modeling-of-the-waste-rock-pile (476 lines)
This Matlab code was designed to use surveying of the pile to create a complex 3D model of the pile with both external topography and internal structure and instrumentation positions. The 3D model is used to provide better inversion results for the 3D time-lapse geoelectrical monitoring of the experimental waste rock pile.

## 02- 3D-modeling-of-the-pile-for-COMSOL (1172 lines)
This Matlab code was designed to create a 3D model of the waste rock pile for the COMSOL Multiphysics modelisation software. External topography and internal structure was used to calculate geometric factors for both standard and optimized protocols. The approach developped to model the pile can be applied to any complex structure to generate a complex 3D high-resolution model for COMSOL Multiphysics with LiveLink for Matlab.

## 03- 3D-geoelectrical-database-to-RES2D\3DINV (638 lines)
This Matlab code was designed to process 3D geoelectrical database of the experimental waste rock pile to RES2DINV and RES3DINV inversion software. Both surface and borehole electrodes are used for meausurements with standard and optimized protocols. 2D and 3D txt files are created for 2D and 3D inversion with user-selected protocols.

## 01- 3D-time-lapse-ERT-monitoring (5220 lines)
This Matlab code was designed to process inversion results (E4D) of the 3D time-lapse geoelectrical monitoring of an experimental waste rock pile. Part I loads geoelectrical database from Excel files and pre-processes the measures. Files of data are created to be inversed with E4D (Johnson, 2010). Part II loads inversion files and post-processes the geophysical images of the waste rock pile overt time in 3D. 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D images are generated from the inversion and geoelectrical data are compared to hydrogeophysical measurements.
